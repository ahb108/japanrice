<p>This application will help a UCL research project on <a
    href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/research/directory/evolution-rice-fuller">The
    Impact of Evolving Rice Systems from China to Southeast Asia</a>
    to develop a better understanding of the relationship between rice
    cultivation, climate and human population.</p>   
        <p>In particular, by taking advantage of some unusally rich statistical
    records from the 1920s and 1930s for rice
    production and human population across different countries and sub-regions of Asia, we
    hope to get a better sense of rice agriculture and its impact
    prior (for the most part) to the major changes
    inflicted by industrialisation. This historical perspective then allows us to build more
    accurate mappings of the likely spread of rice agriculture in much
    earlier periods and, amongst other things, to estimate
    possible increased methane outputs (a
    greenhouse gas associated with global warming) from early rice production. The
    current application focuses on transcription of rice production statistics
    from Japan, spanning the years 1883-1954, and is also kindly supported by
    Nara University.

            The application loads a scanned image showing a table of statistical data and asks people 
            to transcribe it into a spreadsheet. Contributors
    with knowledge of Japanese can add headings in both Japanese
    script and translated into English if they are able, but anyone can contribute to transcribing the
    statistics, as we provide a rough indication of the meaning of the
    repeated headings on these pages.
