					This application is very simple. When you
					participate, the platform will load a scanned table of statistical
					data referring to rice production across Japan in the years 1883-1954. Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked
					to transcribe the contents of the table(s) you see in the image. Any further
					information can be placed in the top row, the bottom row or an
					extra final column. If you can read and write Japanese then please add these headings (with an English translation alongside if you can). If you cannot read Japanese then transcription of the numerical data will still be very useful (as the headings are standardised and we can add them later). 
					An example portion of a statistical table is provided below, 
					along with brief description of the contents of the Japanese headings.

					Some further bits of guidance as you transcribe:
					<ul>
						<li>
							When the table is first loaded, you will be prompted to define the correct number of total columns in the loaded table, 
							so please check this carefully. We suggest that you extra columns to the total number of observed columns if you wish to add headings, 
							translated headings and/or your own
							comments (e.g. if the observable table
							has 4 columns, stipulate 5, 6 or 7 columns and use the
							the extra ones as you wish).
						</li>
						<li>
							The number of rows will expand as you type. Please do not worry if you leave a blank final row.
							If a word is hard to decipher, do you best to identify it
							and make a comment in your extra column to note
							the problem. We have also split each sheet into two (with ovrelap), 
							so do not be surprised if you see a lack of headings and ignore any numbers/lines that are partially cut off.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you find it easier, you can transcribe into
							an offline spreadsheet and then copy-and-paste
							the results into the online table in one go. However, bear in mind that
							a delay in submitting the online table
							might then mean that other
							contributors complete this task before you do and
							thereby make your efforts unnecessary!
						</li>
					</ul>
